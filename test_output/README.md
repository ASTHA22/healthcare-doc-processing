# Test Outputs

This directory contains sample test outputs generated by the document processing pipeline. These files are included in version control to:

1. Provide examples of the expected output format
2. Allow for comparison of results across different versions
3. Serve as documentation of the processing pipeline's capabilities

## Files

- `test_results_*.txt`: Sample output files showing the results of processing different document types
  - Includes input text, extracted fields, and validation results

## Regenerating Test Outputs

To regenerate these test outputs:

```bash
# Run the test pipeline
python test_pipeline.py

# The new outputs will be saved in this directory with a new timestamp
```

## Note

These test outputs are generated using the built-in sample data and don't require Azure credentials. For testing with real Azure services, you'll need to set up the appropriate credentials in the `.env` file.
